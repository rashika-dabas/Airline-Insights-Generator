# Sample-Superstore-Analyzer
## Step-1: Data Analysis
1. Analysis: Identify and document the level of completeness, inconsistencies, redundancies, and duplicates. Sample Superstore is the data source used to generate your reports.
2. Target Audience:
* Use assumptions to define your target audience for both, the operational and executive reports.
* Explain the intended use of each report (i.e.: monitor and control, decisionmaking, performance improvement, research analysis), and what would be achievable by using these reports.
4. Context and Additional Assumptions: Describe the context in which reports will be created, maintained, and used, and any additional assumptions needed to develop the operational and executive reports.
5. Operational and Executive Reports:
* Define and document the information each report will display (i.e.: sales, geography, customers, revenue, custom KPIs, etc.). If required, incorporate additional data including ad hoc calculations (formulas/algorithms).
* Document and explain each formula, KPIs and ratios used in the reports. Produce a document with this information.
6. Once the reportsâ€™ objectives and the data each report will show are identified, proceed to design empty templates, one for the Operational Report and one for the Executive Report, indicating the context: titles, column titles, date/period, units (examples below).
